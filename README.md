Roblox Game Documentation

The document provides an overview. The overview describes the Roblox game project.

Overview
I'm making a Roblox game that focuses on action, The game pulls ideas, from JJK and OP.
Players level up. Players explore the islands. Players advance through the ranks.

Patents (Ranks)
The game has a Patent system. I notice that the Patent system works like ranks or badges, for players.
Patents are used to:
• Track player progression
• Display status
• Unlock specific features or content

Gameplay Highlights
Core gameplay elements include:
• Strategic use of abilities
• Advancement through ranks
• Exploration and discovery across islands
• Clear and responsive feedback during actions

Visual Style
• Anime-inspired presentation
• Clean and readable effects
• Distinct visual cues for abilities and areas

Current Status
• Game name: Not yet defined
• Core ideas established
• Systems and mechanics under active testing and refinement

Notes
I wrote this documentation to show the scope of the project.
